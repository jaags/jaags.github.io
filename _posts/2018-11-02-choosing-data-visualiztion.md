There are four basic presentation types that you can use to present your data:

- Comparison
- Composition
- Distribution
- Relationship

### Tables 

<div class="row">
  <div class="column"></div>
Tables are essentially the source for all the charts. They are best used for comparison, composition, or relationship analysis when there are only few variables and data points.

</div>

### Column Charts
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"></div>
The column chart is probably the most used chart type. This chart is best used to compare different values when specific values are important, and it is expected that users will look up and compare individual values between each column.

### Column Histograms

<div class="row">
  <div class="column"></div>
Histogram is a common variation of column charts used to present distribution and relationships of a single variable over a set of categories. A good example of a histogram would be a distribution of grades on a school exam or the sizes of pumpkins, divided by size group, in a pumpkin festival.

### Stacked Column Charts

Use stacked column charts to show a composition. Do not use too many composition items (not more than three or four) and make sure the composing parts are relatively similar in size. It can get messy very quickly.



### Bar Charts

If you have long category names, it is best to use bar charts because they give more space for long text. You should also use bar charts, instead of column charts, when the number of categories is greater than seven (but not more than fifteen) or for displaying a set with negative numbers.

### Bar Histogram Charts

A good histogram example is a population distribution by the age (and sex). Remember those Christmas-tree graphs?

### Stacked Bar Charts

### Line Charts

Line charts are among the most frequently used chart types. Use lines when you have a continuous data set. These are best suited for trend-based visualizations of data over a period of time, when the number of data points is very high

### Timeline Charts

The timeline chart is a variation of line charts. Obviously, any line chart that shows values over a period of time is a timeline chart. The only difference is in functionality — most timeline charts will let you zoom in and out and compress or stretch the time axis to see more details or overall trends.

### Area Charts

An area chart is essentially a line chart — good for trends and some comparisons. Area charts will fill up the area below the line, so the best use for this type of chart is for presenting accumulative value changes over time, like item stock, number of employees, or a savings account.

### Stacked Area

Stacked area charts are best used to show changes in composition over time. A good example would be the changes of market share among top players or revenue shares by product line over a period of time.

### Pie Charts and Donut Charts

### Stacked Donut Charts

### Scatter Charts

Scatter charts are primarily used for correlation and distribution analysis. Good for showing the relationship between two different variables where one correlates to another (or doesn’t).

Scatter charts can also show the data distribution or clustering trends and help you spot anomalies or outliers.

### Bubble Charts

A bubble chart is a great option if you need to add another dimension to a scatter plot chart. Scatter plots compare two values, but you can add bubble size as the third variable and thus enable comparison. If the bubbles are very similar in size, use labels.

### Map Charts

Map charts are good for giving your numbers a geographical context to quickly spot best and worst performing areas, trends, and outliers. If you have any kind of location data like coordinates, country names, state names or abbreviations, or addresses, you can plot related data on a map.
### Gantt Charts

Gantt charts are good for planning and scheduling projects. Gantt charts are essentially project maps, illustrating what needs to be done, in what order, and by what deadline. You can visualize the total time a project should take, the resources involved, as well as the order and dependencies of tasks.

### Gauge Charts

Gauge charts are good for displaying KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). They typically display a single key value, comparing it to a color-coded performance level indicator, typically showing green for “good” and red for “trouble.”

### Multi Axes Charts

There are times when a simple chart just cannot tell the whole story. If you want to show relationships and compare variables on vastly different scales, the best option might be to have multiple axes.
