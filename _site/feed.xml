In 2018, Microsoft released [Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/) to GA, introducing another query language that is specifically optimized for semi-structured, unstructured, and time-series data. Even though we have many querying language options,  they are all grounded in a field of mathematics called _relational algebra_.

# What is Relational Algebra?

Relational Algebra is an algebra where operands are defined as relations, or variables that represent relations. This is why relational algebra provides the basis for a query language in relational databases.

# The Core Relational Algebra Concepts

## Union $$\cup$$

Given relations $$R$$ and $$S$$, $$R \cup S = \\{T \| T \in R \vee T \in S\\}$$. In SQL, this is written as

```
SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

UNION

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]
```

## Intersection $$\cap$$

Given relations $$R$$ and $$S$$, $$R \cap S = \\{T \| T \in R \wedge T \in S\\}$$. In SQL, this is written as

```
SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

INTERSECT

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]
```

## Difference $$\setminus$$

Given relations $$R$$ and $$S$$, $$R \setminus S = \\{T \| T \in R \wedge T \notin S\\}$$. In SQL, this is commonly written as

```
SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]

EXCEPT

SELECT column1 [, column2 ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
[WHERE condition]
```

However, a `LEFT JOIN` operator can also perform the same functionality.

## Selection $$\sigma$$

Given relation $$R$$, $$\sigma_{p}(R)$$ is selecting typles that satisfy predicate $$p = a \theta b$$ or $$p = a \theta v$$ from a relation $$R$$. $$a$$ and $$b$$ are attribute names, $$v$$ is a value constant, and $$\theta$$ is a binary operation in $$\\{&lt;. \le, =, \neq, \ge, &gt;\\}$$. In SQL, this is simply the `WHERE` keyword. Given table `R`:

```
SELECT *
FROM R
[WHERE predicate condition]
```

## Projection $$\prod$$

Given relation $$R$$, $$\prod_{a_1, ..., a_n}(R)$$ is projecting a set obtained when the components of relation $$R$$ are restricted to the set $$\\{a_1, ..., a_n\\}$$. In SQL, the `SELECT` operator performs this functionality. Given table `R` with attributes `a`, `b`, `c`

```
SELECT a, b, c
FROM R;
```

_Fun Fact_: the query language from Azure Data Explorer actually has a `project` keyword that behaves exactly like this. Given table `R` with attributes `a`, `b`, `c`:

```
R
| project a, b, c
```

## Products $$\times$$

Given relations $$R$$ and $$S$$, $$R \times S = \\{(r,s) \| r \in R and s \in S\\}$$. In SQL, this is known as a `CROSS JOIN`:

```
SELECT * 
FROM table1 
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

## Joins

There are several joins we are interested in:

### Natural Join $$\Join$$

Given relations $$R$$ and $$S$$, $$R \Join S$$ is the set of all combinations of tuples in $$R$$ and $$S$$ that are equal on their common attribute names. Formally:

$$R \Join S = \\{r \cup s \| r \in R \wedge s \in S \wedge \text{Fun}(r \cup s)\\}$$

In SQL, this is known as the `NATURAL JOIN`:

```
SELECT * 
FROM table1 
NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

### Theta Join $$\Join_{c}$$

Given relations $$R$$ and $$S$$, $$R \Join_c S$$ takes the product $$R \times S$$, then apply $$\sigma_c$$ to the result.

## Renaming $$\rho$$

Given relation $$R$$, $$\rho_{R(a_1, ..., a_n}(R)$$ makes the resulting relation be one with attributes $$a_1, ..., a_n$$ and the same tuples as $$R$$. In SQL, the `AS` operator allows for remaining of attributes:

```
SELECT a AS apple, b AS banana
FROM R

In the following, let's install Node-RED on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Long Term Support) that requires Node.js and npm (node package manager).

### Installing Node.js

Installing Node.js is easy on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS by typing in the below command on the terminal:

`$ sudo apt-get install nodejs`

Once the installation is done, check the version of the node by issue the command:

`$ node -v`
`v8.9.4`


As Nodej.js uses a package manager called npm that allows in install and manage packages. Since Node-RED is an &quot;over-layer graphics&quot; of Node.js, it's manadotary to install it.

`$ sudo apt-get install npm`

When the installation is complete, check the version. If the things are fine, else error would be returned.

`$ npm -v`
`6.8.0`

### Installing Node-RED 

To install Node-RED using npm and admin module which add few tools along, issue the command:

`sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red node-red-admin`

    Options: 
      -g            - install the Node-RED module in the global directory
      -unsafe-perm  - overrides any errors that may occur during installation


Port:

Node-RED uses port 1880 by default. Hence, it must be enabled using UncomplicatedFirewall (ufw).

`$ sudo ufw allow 1880`


### Runing Node-RED locally:
