The length of the vector is referred to as the vector norm or the vector’s magnitude.

    The length of a vector is a nonnegative number that describes the extent of the vector in space, 
    and is sometimes referred to as the vector’s magnitude or the norm.

### Vector L1 Norm

The length of a vector can be calculated using the L1 norm, where the 1 is a superscript of the L, e.g. L^1.
The notation for the L1 norm of a vector is ||v||1, where 1 is a subscript.


example:

`||v||1 = |a1| + |a2| + |a3|`
